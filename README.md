# Datasets-used-for-the-SMoC-paper
Datasets for a journal paper "Spatial mode-based calibration (SMoC) of forecast precipitation fields from numerical weather prediction models".

In the SMoC paper, the performance of SMoC is evaluated by applying it to forecasts of substantive precipitation events over the Brisbane Drainage Basin
in eastern Australia. This repository provides datasets of precipitation forecasts (3 years) and observations (33 years) at a grid spacing of 0.05° x 0.05°
and on a daily basis: (1) Forecasts: "3-year forecast data.nc"; (2) Corresponding observations: "3-year observation data.nc"; (3) Long-term observations:
"30-year observation data.nc". These three files are compressed into "Forecast and observation data.zip".
